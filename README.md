# Client-Server-Programming
C code
A very simple authentication program. The user on the client side enters login credentials, username and password. Sends the credentials to the server side to verify the username 
and password. Server sends proceed message if credentials are valid, else it sends denied message if credentials are invalid. Before sending a denied message, user gets 3 attempts
to enter correct credentials. Otherwise, denied message will be shown on client. Number of attempts left will be sent to client too.
